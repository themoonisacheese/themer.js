This is themer.js, a tool for generating custom themes for discord.

If installing a bunch of stuff is not your forte, a WebApp version
is available at https://themoonisacheese.github.io/themer.js/webapp/

In case you REALLY want to download and run it:

It requires:

-node.js
https://nodejs.org/en/
-BetterDiscord
https://betterdiscord.net/home/

To use:
1:Install node.js and BetterDiscord
2:Run themer.bat
3:Follow the instructions on the screen
4:A file with the appropriate name will be generated in the same folder.
5:Place that file in %appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes
6:In discord, go to settings>Themes and check the box next to the theme to apply it
  If it does not show up, quit discord fully, then restart it.
